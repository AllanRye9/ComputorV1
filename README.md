# ComputorV1

The project based on mathematical formula of polynomials considering the principles that validates the equation . There are 3 steps in solving the equation using codes , firstly simplifying the equation based on divisibility or common factors which can be directly solved for less than 2 roots.
secondly finding the roots the maximium roots for the project is 2 called a quadratic mean while more roots can be attained of which is not advisable since solving such roots are complex
oftenly resulting in computational error or an plottable on the graph for example a cubic root or root of 3 when computated usually gives infinite values that are un plottable on the graph.
For the roots of 2 , it is calculted using quadratic equation that generates values for x and y axis and when plotted it produces a parabola that is either upwards for the positive value
or downwards for negative value.

The determinant of a quadratic equation is attained by finding the highest value of exponent usually got by arrangement of exponents in descending order and the maximium value selected.

Key terms used;
exponents, determinant, constant or coefficient, variable.
**NB: ** Polynomials can only have positive exponents and maximium of 2 roots for upward and downwards parabola plotting on the graph.
Thereby allowing the use of quadratic equation.
