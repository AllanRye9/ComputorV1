Polynomial Mathematics Solver

A polynomial mathematics project that parses, simplifies, and analyzes polynomial equations.
The application reduces polynomial expressions to their canonical form, determines the polynomial degree, and validates mathematical correctness.
This project focuses on parsing logic, mathematical validation, and robust error handling, making it a strong example of problem-solving and backend-style logic.

✨ Features

Parse polynomial expressions with positive and negative coefficients
Reduce equations to standard (reduced) form
Detect and calculate the polynomial degree
Handle missing terms (e.g. X² not explicitly provided)
Validate invalid characters and malformed input
Support for floating-point coefficients
Clear error reporting for unsupported degrees
